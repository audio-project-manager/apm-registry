It enables for a stronger, more consistent presence of high frequency material and works particularly well with vocals, synths and strings.\n\nThe process is made easy by a simple user interface, automatic makeup gain and a combined function 'AIR' knob. \n\nRoth-AIR is available for free in 32-bit and 64-bit as VST and AU (OS X only) plugins for Windows and Mac.","homepage":"http://www.danielrothmann.com/","id":"rothair","name":"Roth-AIR","files":{"audio":{"name":"","size":0},"image":{"name":"https://central.owlplug.com/products/rothair/rothair.png","size":0},"linux":{"name":"","size":0},"mac":{"name":"https://central.owlplug.com/products/rothair/bundles/rothair-vst-osx.zip","size":2957000},"win":{"name":"https://central.owlplug.com/products/rothair/bundles/rothair-vst-win64.zip","size":2981000}},"release":"v1.1.0","repo":"owlplug/central","tags":["Compressor","Mastering"],"version":"0.0.0"}},"__N_SSG":true}
