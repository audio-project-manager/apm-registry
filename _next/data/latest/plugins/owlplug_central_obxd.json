It attempts to recreate its sound and behavior, but as the original was very limited in some important ways a number of things were added or altered to the original design.\nThe OB-Xd was designed to sound as good and as rich as the original. It implements micro random detuning which is a big part of that sound. However, it was not designed as a self-contained completely independent soft-synth. It needs to be contained within a VST framework where things like transposition, automation, layering, arpeggiation, etc., are available. Also, like many synths of the OB-X's generation, the OB-Xd has no internal effects so its sounds and textures can be greatly enhanced by the use of additional processing like chorus, reverb, delay, etc.","homepage":"https://obxd.wordpress.com/","id":"obxd","name":"OB-Xd","files":{"audio":{"name":"","size":0},"image":{"name":"https://central.owlplug.com/products/obxd/obxd.png","size":0},"linux":{"name":"","size":0},"mac":{"name":"","size":0},"win":{"name":"https://central.owlplug.com/products/obxd/bundles/obxd-vst-win64.zip","size":2229000}},"release":"v1.1.0","repo":"owlplug/central","tags":["Synth","Analog"],"version":"0.1.4"}},"__N_SSG":true}
